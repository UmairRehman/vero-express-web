By accessing the TripGuide website, mobile or tablet application, or any other feature or other TripGuide platform (collectively, 'Our Website'), you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions ('Terms') and our Privacy Policy. If you do not accept all of these Terms, then you may not use Our Website. In these Terms, 'we', 'us', 'our' and 'TripGuid' refer to TripGuide Software Corporation, 'your' refers to you, the user of Our Website.</p>

                    <p>Our Website is a travel search engine. Tripguid does not provide, own or control any of the travel services and products that you can access through Our Website, such as flights, accommodations, rental cars, packages, or travel insurance (the 'Travel Products'). The Travel Products are owned, controlled or made available by third parties (the 'Travel Providers') either directly (e.g., airline) or as an agent (e.g., online travel agency). The Travel Providers are responsible for the Travel Products. The Travel Provider’s terms and privacy policies apply to your booking, so you must agree to and understand those terms. Furthermore, the terms of the actual travel provider (airline, hotel, tour operator, etc.) apply to your travel, so you must also agree to and understand those terms. Your interaction with any Travel Provider accessed through Our Website is at your own risk; KAYAK does not bear any responsibility should anything go wrong with your booking or during your travel.</p>

                    <p>KAYAK hosts content, including prices, made available by or obtained from Travel Providers. KAYAK is in no way responsible for the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of such content. Since KAYAK has no control over the Travel Products and does not verify the content uploaded by the Travel Providers, it is not possible for us to guarantee the prices displayed on Our Website. Prices change constantly and additional charges (e.g., payment fees, services charges, checked-in luggage fees, local taxes and fees) may apply, so you should always check whether the price asked for a booking is the one you expected. More details here. Some Travel Products may also be sold in another currency than the one preset or chosen by you for the display of the search results. Our currency conversion is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as accurate or real-time; actual rates may vary, and your payment provider (e.g., your credit card company) may charge conversion fees and apply another date’s currency rate.</p>


                    <h4>2. Booking through Vero 1</h4>

                    <p>If you make a booking through Our Website for Travel Products, that booking is made with the Travel Provider named on the booking page and Our Website only acts as a user interface. Accordingly, TripGuide has no responsibility for the booking or the Travel Product because TripGuide has no involvement in creating the description of the Travel Product, in defining the price and any fees, or in providing the Travel Products that you book. If you have any issues or disputes with your booking and/or the Travel Product, you agree to address and resolve these with the Travel Provider and not with us.
                    </p>

Our content is largely generated in an automated fashion; errors can and do happen. We usually have many search results, but we are not comprehensive and do not display all available providers and offers. Accordingly, we do not always display the lowest available price. KAYAK expressly disclaims—to the fullest extent permissible—all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and security and accuracy, as well as all warranties arising by usage of trade, course of dealing, or course of performance.

                        We (together with our officers, directors, employees, representatives, shareholders, affiliates, and providers), to the extent permitted by law, hereby expressly exclude any responsibility and liability for (a) any loss or damages to, or viruses that may infect, your computer equipment or other property as the result of your access to Our Website, your downloading of any content from Our Website or your use of Trips or (b) any injury; death; loss; claim; act of god; accident; delay; or any direct, special, exemplary, punitive, indirect, incidental or consequential damages of any kind (including—without limitation—lost profits or lost savings), whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, that arise out of or is in any way connected with: (i) any use of Our Website</p>

                    <h5>10. Air carrier rules</h5>

                    <p>
                        The circumvention of an air carrier's rules, including practices such as back-to-back ticketing (purchasing two or more tickets with overlapping travel dates in order to circumvent minimum stay requirements) and hidden-city ticketing (purchasing tickets including segments which the purchaser does not intend to use in order to circumvent an air carrier's pricing structure), is prohibited by many air carriers. The use of prohibited ticketing practices may result in the air carrier taking actions, including the cancellation of the ticket, denied boarding, revocation of frequent flier miles and other benefits, additional charges to the purchaser's credit card, additional charges collected at the airport, or future invoicing.
